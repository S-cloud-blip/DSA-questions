Problem
Chef has two variables 
�
X and 
�
Y. He wants to find out whether the variables satisfy the equation:

�

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
�
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two integers 
�
X and 
�
Y, as mentioned in statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output YES if the variables 
�
X and 
�
Y satisfy the given equation, NO otherwise.

You may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, Yes, YES, yes, and YeS are all considered the same.
